### Description

This provides documentation of the workflow of generating flow around low-rise buildings exposed to ASCE-defined wind speed profiles using CFD with Jupyter Notebook. The available features of the existing Jupyter Notebook are simulations using a uniform inflow condition. In the new versions of the Notebooks inflow conditions provided by the ASCE 7 are incorporated along with two other options. One relates to user-defined inflow and the other further includes turbulent fluctuations in the inflow flowing a mean velocity profile.
The current Notebook referred to as the base case has uniform mean velocity with user-defined magnitude. It is illustrated in the following figure:

![fig1](img2/Picture1.png)

The overall workflow is described in the following schematic.

### New Features
The new features include the implementation of power-law inflow profiles in codes/standards and the introduction of the option of user-defined inflow conditions. The following Figure shows the difference between velocity profiles in the urban and suburban areas.

The wind speed profile is described as

The workflow from the OpenFOAM to Jupyter Notebook is given below. The final outcome is the velocity profile shown in the bottom right of the figure.
